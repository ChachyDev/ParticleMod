# Particle Addon
A hyperium port of dewgs multiplier mod.

**Features** 
* Gui to control everything
* Extra settings compared to the mod
* Multiply Critical Hits (The original idea of the mod.)

**Developing**

If you are a developer and you are planning on committing to Particle Addon make sure all code is tested and is in a strict format.

Any code that isn't will not be accepted or you will be asked to format it.

If you are using a debug environment, it is recommended to use [DCEVM](https://github.com/dcevm/dcevm/releases) as an alternate VM, if you have it installed add this to your VM ARGUMENTS `-XXaltjvm=dcevm.` This will allow you to do more hotswapping without having to restart your client!

Head over to their releases and download it!
